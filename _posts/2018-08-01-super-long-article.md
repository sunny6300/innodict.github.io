Hello ninjas, This is my first article on internet.Here, I am gonna be posting lots of articles related to cyber security and hacking. You get to learn deep about web application and mobile application penetration testing and lot more ;)

Let me start it with little bit about myself. I am Sunny Singh working for an organization as information security analyst. I am one of the enthusiats who wants to learn everything around me about cyber security and hacking. I started this back in my college days when I used to make mods of android games by changing their internal storage on a rooted devices and slowly I realized that I want to learn it more than anything. This is when hacking became my passion and I started working hard on it. 

See you in next article which is probably gonna be technical or related to hacking. Keep thinking, keep hacking :)
