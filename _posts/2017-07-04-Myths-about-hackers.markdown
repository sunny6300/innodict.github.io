When you hear the word "hacker", your mind goes to a guy with black hoodie, sitting on high configured systems in a dark room who breaks into other computers and takes over other people's accounts. But the truth is totally different. This myth has been created by the media and people around us.

A hacker is a type of hands-on, experimenting mad scientist. The one who is motivated, resourceful, creative and they get deeply into how things work, to the point where one can take control of them and change them into something else. Their curiosity makes them dig to the bottom of how things function.


Everyone who has made some changes going deep into something, is a hacker. It is not something specific to computer systems or softwares. A little kid who is playing with a toy and out of curiosity it opens up the toy and makes some changes in order to make it work different from earlier, is a hacker because it goes deep into the functionality of the toy, learns how it functions and makes changes to feel the difference.

A hacker is a researcher who tries something again and again in multiple ways to see how things response. Hackers are the ones who aren't afraid of making mistakes again and again instead they learn something new everytime they make mistakes. In the field of Information Technology, there have been two types of hackers. The ones who use their skills in a legitimate, lawful manner to try to find vulnerabilities and fix them before the bad guys can get there and try to break in. And another who use their skills in getting unautherised access to something unlawfully. In my personal opinion they should be called criminals and not hackers.
