Hi there, This is gonna be a walkthrough on an intentionally vulnerable box for beginners who is just starting to practice on vulnerable boxes from vulnhub. 'Basic Pentesting:1' is an intentionally vulnerable ubuntu machine created by 'Josiah Pierce' for beginners. 

Before getting into the practice on boot2root. Let me tell you the requirments of starting practice on vulnerable machines. It's good if you have kali linux installed on your system as primary OS or Virtual Machine will also be fine. I would recommend to have virtual box installed on you system which is absolutely free of cost. Now let's download 'Basic Pentesting:1' box from vulnhub website. Basically you get .ova file which is perfect for virtual box. Once downloaded, double click on Basic_pentesting:1.ova file and it will open in virtual box. Leave the settings as it is and install it. So now we are ready to jump into pentesting.

Open the newly installed machine on your virtual box which is basically ubuntu desktop. Login  as guest user, go to ternimal and the ip address of the machine. However you can do the same using 'netdiscover' command in your kali machine. Now fire up your kali machine and let's start gathering some information about the machine. Let's scan the ports running on the machine first and for that we are gonna be using one of the best tools called 'nmap'. In order to use nmap, open terminal and type 'nmap -sV -p- ipaddress(in my case 192.168.1.10)'. So basically we are asking nmap to scan all ports by giving '-p-' command and all the running services by giving '-sV' command. Refer the screenshot.

Now fire up metasploit framework in another terminal tab using 'msfconsole' command. Start postgresql using 'systemctl start postgresql' command and check the status if it's started using 'systemctl status postgresql' command. Refer screeshot for that.

Once postgresql started, we are good to go with metasploit. Now let us get back to nmap and check the running ports and services on our target. As we can see there is a service 'ProFTPD' running on target machine.

Let us get back to metaploit and check if there is any exploit available for particular service. We will use search command to check the exploit. Use 'search ProFTPD 1.3.3c' command as done below.

As we can there is are many exploits available for this version. Let us choose the fifth one as it has command code execution vulnerability. copy the exploit as shown in the screenshot.

Now we are gonna be using 'use' commmand to use the particular exploit. see it in screenshot below.

Now we have to look for the options that we haev to provide in order to exploit the vulnerability. Use 'show options' command for getting about the options. Refer screenshot.

As we can see there are something called RHOST and RPORT which are required to user the exploit. However RPORT is already set so we don't have to worry about that.

Let us set the rhost which is nothing but the ip adddress of target. We can use 'set' command to set any value. Run a command 'set rhost 192.168.1.10'(target ip). Refer Screenshot...

Once rhost is set, we are good to go and use 'exploit' command to eploit the vulnerability. As we can see in screenshot, we got a session running.Refer screenshot..

![](/assets/img/vulnhub_box/Basic_Pentesting-1/10.png)

We have got access to command shell. Let us see the working directory and who is user. We have to use 'whoami' command to know the user. As we can see it's root. So we have got access.

![](/assets/img/vulnhub_box/Basic_Pentesting-1/12.png)

Let us change the root password by using command 'passwd'. And enter a new password. So this is the way you changed root password.

 Now we have to hack another user on machine which is 'marlinspike'. For that we need to run a command 'sudo -i -u marlinspike' and it will change user from 'root' to 'marlinspike'.
 
 ![](/assets/img/vulnhub_box/Basic_Pentesting-1/15.png)
 
 Give 'whoami'command to check the user name which is marlinspike.
 
 ![](/assets/img/vulnhub_box/Basic_Pentesting-1/16.png)
 
 Now let us change the user's password. We will again use same command to change the password. But this time it asks for current password for the user that we don't have. Let give it a try if it is same as user name. Fortunately the password is same as user name so now using older password, we will change with new password.

 Now we own both user and root as we have changed password for both. Let use try doing ssh. Use 'ssh marlinspike@192.168.1.10' and password will be the one that we changed. In my case it is 'User1234'.
