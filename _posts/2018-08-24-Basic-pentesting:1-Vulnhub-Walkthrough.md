Hi there, This is gonna be a walkthrough on an intentionally vulnerable box for beginners who is just starting to practice on vulnerable boxes from vulnhub. 'Basic Pentesting:1' is an intentionally vulnerable ubuntu machine created by 'Josiah Pierce' for beginners. 

Before getting into the practice on boot2root. Let me tell you the requirments of starting practice on vulnerable machines. It's good if you have kali linu installed on your system as primary OS or Virtual Machine will also be fine. I would recommend to have virtual box installed on you system which is absolutely free of cost. Now let's download 'Basic Pentesting:1' box from vulnhub website. Basically you get .ova file which is perfect for virtual box. Once downloaded, double click on .on Basic_pentesting:1.ova file and it will open in virtual box. Leave the settings as it is and install it. So now we are ready to jump into pentesting.

Open the newly installed machine on your virtual box which is basically ubuntu desktop. Login  as guest user, go to ternimal and the ip address of the machine. However you can do the same using 'netdiscover' command in your kali machine. Now fire up your kali machine and let's start gathering some information about the machine. Let's scan the ports running on the machine first and for that we are gona be using one of the best tools called 'nmap'. In order to use nmap, open terminal and type 'nmap -sV -p- ipaddress(in my case 192.168.1.10)'. So basically we are asking nmap to scan all ports by giving '-p-' command and all the running services by giving '-sV' command. Refer the screenshot.
